É um momento que afasta-se da família e adere ao coletivo. É uma fase onde as estratégias de enfrentamento ainda não estão completamente desenvolvidas, podendo apresentar dificuldades de expressar sentimentos. A exposição aos meios de tecnologia impactam na qualidade de vida, como por exemplo no processo do sono. O uso de drogas nesse período de vulnerabilidade faz com que esses  adolescentes se exponham a outros riscos que vão além dos danos que a própria substância pode causar ao organismo. Nessa perspectiva, este estudo busca analisar a discrepância de relato entre mães e filhos no tempo de uso de tela e no uso de substância ilícitas, bem como avaliar se esta diferença muda de acordo com a idade do participante. Dessa forma, pode-se elaborar futuras intervenções focadas na otimização da comunicação dos jovens e responsáveis, buscando aproximação e maior qualidade nas relações. Assim é possível orientar, prevenir e buscar acompanhamento, se necessário, precocemente, para o uso abusivo de ambos.","Resilience to mental disorders is a complex issue involving multiple factors, such as personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics. It is possible that protective factors, such as parental bonding, cognitive reserve, and physical fitness can delay or avoid the development of mental disorders. Analyzing these factors in individuals at-risk to develop mental illnesses, such as children that have parents with mental disorders, that are living in problematic economic conditions, that have suffered trauma, or that have low access to public health systems, can be an effective way to understand their mechanism and their impact in prevention. We are specially  interested in evaluating modifiable factors that can be the focus of new interventions in this population.","The network hypothesis of mental health and related domains suggests that an individual's state can be described by a network of interacting factors. We would like to understand the temporal network effects (i.e., lagged effects) between these factors. In particular, is the dependency structure different across different in categorically defined cohorts (e.g., those with different diagnoses as defined in the 'proc_dawba' & 'dawbanet_diag_w0w2' files) or related to continuous variables (e.g., those defined in the SDQ and Short Wellbeing scale as used during the COVID wave), and if so, how different are they and what triggers those differences? We consider the BHRC EMA data to be a great data set to address these questions.","Childhood exposure to traumatic events has been reported to impact neurodevelopment, representing a leading risk factor for behavioral and psychiatric disease during adulthood (PMID: 30983960, PMID: 36946124, PMID: 29779964, PMID: 33315268). While neural correlates of trauma exposure have been reported in the adult population, studies assessing the impact on brain development and on blood transcriptomic changes are still scarce. The aims of this study are: i) to identify the peripheral transcriptomic profiles as well as the structural and functional alterations associated with childhood trauma subtypes (i.e. sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, and neglect); ii) to study how these alterations change during adolescence; iii) to evaluate the predictive power of transcriptional and neuroimaging variables on mental and physical health and cognitive performance.","The increasing prevalence of digital technology use among adolescents has raised concerns about its potential impact on mental health outcomes. Research suggests that excessive technology use may be both a contributor to and an indicator of underlying mental health difficulties, particularly among vulnerable youth. While these technologies offer benefits, excessive use has been associated with adverse outcomes, including depression, anxiety, social isolation, and sleep disturbances. High-risk adolescents may be particularly susceptible to developing problematic use patterns, possibly using digital technologies as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Recent advances in genetic research, particularly through polygenic risk scores (PRS), have suggested a potential genetic predisposition to both mental health vulnerabilities and addictive behaviors, including problematic technology use. However, the relationship between digital technology use, mental health, and genetic risk remains poorly understood. This study seeks to validate measurement tools and explore the complex interplay between problematic digital technology use, mental health indicators, and polygenic risk scores in a high-risk cohort.\n","Adolescence is a key neurodevelopment stage, with changes shaping cognitive and emotional functions. Brain-age models are valuable tools to assess brain health, capturing the impact of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. In adolescents, socioeconomic inequality, limited healthcare access, and pollution can disrupt brain development, affecting mental health and cognition. Yet, research on brain-age models in this group remains scarce, particularly in populations facing genetic and social challenges. Physical activity and other lifestyle factors have shown a protective impact on the brain in general and, in some studies, on accelerated aging. However, no studies have addressed adolescent populations, especially vulnerable ones. This represents a unique opportunity to investigate and develop protective methods for underserved populations.","Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation, cognitive performance, and academic outcomes. However, sleep quality can be influenced by individual lifestyle choices. In particular, substance use may worsen sleep quality and cognitive functioning, while physical activity is known to improve both. This project investigates how the relationship between sleep and learning may vary depending on behavioral habits such as physical activity and substance use. The goal is to understand how these factors shape cognitive outcomes and identify potential targets for promoting healthier development."],"aims_aims_max_5":["- Comparar a diferença de relato entre mães e filhos no tempo de uso de tela e no uso de substância ilícitas\n- Avaliar se esta diferença muda de acordo com a idade do participante",null,null,null,null,null,null],"hypo_hypothesis_max_5":["- mães não tem uma boa percepção do tempo de tela, assim como, já é bem estabelecido na literatura, e não tem conhecimento sobre o uso de substância dos filhos\n- haverá uma maior discrepância sobre uso de tela nos mais velhos (w2) e uma maior discrepância no uso de substância nos mais novos (w1), pois haveria uma tendência dos mais velhos já terem aberto essa informação com pais","This is an exploratory study to investigate how protective factors impact the development of psychopathology in individuals that are already at greater risk of developing such conditions. Through the understanding of which variables are more prevalent in resilient individuals, we may have a more wholesome understanding of how these factors interplay with each other and what protective variables have the potential to change disease trajectories.","We suspect that there will be differences in the weights of edges and potentially structure of the networks across individuals. Whether those differences are consistent across different cohorts is an unknown.","This proposal aims to answer 4 research questions:\n1) Do childhood traumatic experiences impact the peripheral transcriptomic profiles? We hypothesize that specific types of childhood traumatic experiences will affect distinct molecular pathways, such as alterations in neuronal plasticity, stress response, and mood regulation as well as inflammation.\n2) Do childhood traumatic experiences impact brain structural features? We hypothesize a reduction of cortical gyrification in brain regions highly expressing glucocorticoids receptor (e.g., prefrontal cortex), cortical thickness of core brain networks (e.g. triple networks system), and volume alterations in regions involved in the neuroendocrine system (e.g., hypothalamus).\n3) Do childhood traumatic experiences impact brain connectivity? We hypothesize a reduction of the modulation of the salience network over the triple network system (lower functional and structural connectivity), and a hyper-reactivity of cortical hubs of the neuroendocrine system (e.g., hypothalamic connectivity).\n4) How these brain and transcriptional changes interact with each other and predict the adolescent mental and physical health and cognitive performance? We expect to identify biological signatures of psychological resilience and vulnerability able to predict the long-term cognitive and behavioral alterations and metabolic dysfunctions.\n","A higher prevalence of mental comorbidities among problematic technology users and an association with polygenic risk scores, particularly for anxiety and depression","Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of physical activity will be associated with a greater reduction in the brain age gap, reflecting a delay in brain aging.\nHypothesis 2: Other lifestyle factors—particularly sleep quality and dietary habits—will also influence the relationship between physical activity and brain aging. However, physical activity is expected to have the strongest independent effect.\nHypothesis 3: The beneficial effects of physical activity will not be limited to global brain aging metrics but will also manifest in specific brain networks previously linked to physical activity.\nHypothesis 4: Social and socioeconomic determinants will modulate the impact of physical activity on brain aging, with diminished effects expected among individuals from more disadvantaged backgrounds.","Reduced learning capacity is associated with poor sleep quality.\n\nHigher physical activity enhances the positive effects of good sleep on learning.\n\nSubstance use weakens the relationship between sleep quality and learning.\n\nThe effects of sleep quality on learning vary across levels of physical activity.\n\nThe effects of sleep quality on learning vary across levels of substance use."],"dataplan_data_analysis_plan_max_20_lines":["Os dados serão submetidos a análises estatísticas utilizando o software SPSS com os seguintes dados da amostra:\nDOMICILIAR: \n- Seção 4–\"Tabagismo, Álcool e Drogas\" Completo\nPSICO:\n- NFAT21. \"Na casa onde você mora HOJE há televisão, computador ou videogame?\"\n- NFAT21a. \"SE SIM, quantas horas por dia, somando tudo, você passa em frente à TV, usando o computador e jogando videogame em média?\"\nCONFIDENCIAL: Completo","First we plan to create a profile of at-risk individuals with the variables cited above. Then, we will identify which of these individuals were diagnosed through DAWBA in the second wave. After, we plan to run a multiple logistic regression to investigate which protective factors were present in the at-risk individuals that did not develop any diagnosis according to DAWBA (dependent variable - divided in two categories: presence or absence of disorder). We will also carry a multivariate linear regression to each variable to analyze their impact on the dependent variable. We plan on using moderating variables in our analysis that could change how the protective variables manifest their effect in the sample such as age, gender, time of important life events (stressors), having good relationships, and well-being scores. We also would like to reduce sample attrition in our regression analysis using variables to calculate inverse probability weights, as seen in other BHRC papers. We plan to use the variables already computed by Pan et al, 2017: maternal education, any anxiety condition, and study site.","We have developed code that allows for the inference of cross-domain dependencies for data that has irregularly time-spaced and incomplete observations using a fully Bayesian approach. This underlying model is a continuous-time autoregressive model with particle filtering methodologies to account for missing observations. We believe this will be ideal for the BHRC EMA data that has randomised time intervals. The network structure will be inferred in a post-hoc analysis where edges are considered present when the weights of the lagged effects from the autoregressive model are significantly different from zero. This will be applied to the BHRC EMA data where we will explore both mixed and random effects models to understand the network structures at both the individual and group level. Model comparison will be performed using internal consistency checks (e.g., posterior predictive checks) and using model comparison techniques (e.g., WAIC).","We will use MRI raw data downloaded from the repository, from all the available timepoints (https://osf.io/ktz5h/?view_only=; Salum et al. 2014). Data will be analyzed according to published pipelines and using standard methodologies and tools, as detailed below:\n(i) Functional MRI (fMRI) data: fMRIPrep, FMRIB Software Library (FSL), Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) (Month 1-12).\n(ii) Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data: FSL. The Figley networks’ atlas will be used to extract microstructural features of white matter tracts (Month 1-12).\n(iii) Structural MRI (3D T1-weighted data): FreeSurfer pipelines (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to compute cortical thickness and gyrification, and subcortical volumes (Desikan-Killiany atlas, Yeo 7 networks atlas) (Month 1-12).\nTranscriptional data will be analyzed using Salmon, Deseq2 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Month 1-6).\nMulti-Omics Factor Analysis framework (MOFA) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) will be applied to track biomolecular pathways across several layers of RNAseq/neuroimaging measurements, revealing which of the peripheral pathway alterations are associated with brain dysfunction and trauma subtypes. The contribution of lifestyle variables will be also evaluated as mediating or moderating factors in the link between the periphery and the brain (Month 13-24).\n","First, descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables, including sociodemographic characteristics, problematic technology use measures, and mental health indicators. To validate the construct of problematic technology use, we will conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the relevant scales, alongside internal consistency analysis (Cronbach's alpha). Convergent and discriminant validity will be assessed through correlations with related measures, such as self report of technology use.\n\nThe association between problematic technology use and other variables will be examined using mixed-effects models, which account for the hierarchical structure of the data and repeated measurements over time. These models will include both fixed effects (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic status) and random effects to account for individual-level variation. The mixed modeling approach will allow us to examine both between-subject and within-subject effects while handling unbalanced data and missing values appropriately.\n\nThe relationship between polygenic risk scores and problematic technology use will be analyzed within the mixed model framework, controlling for relevant covariates. Mediation and moderation analyses will be conducted to explore potential pathways between genetic risk, mental health symptoms, and problematic technology use.\n\nAll analyses will account for multiple testing using appropriate corrections. Missing data will be handled through multiple imputation when appropriate. Statistical significance will be set at p < 0.05, and all analyses will be performed using R software.\n","The fMRI dataset consists of 739 adolescents from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort (BHRC) study, with data collected in Porto Alegre and São Paulo. Preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data will be conducted using the fmriprep toolbox, followed by additional processing with the CONN22 toolbox, including Gaussian smoothing (6 × 6 × 6 mm), signal denoising via linear regression for confounding effects, and a band-pass filter (0.008–0.09 Hz). Region-of-interest analysis will be performed using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL90) atlas to reduce data dimensionality for machine learning. High-order interactions between brain regions will be estimated using the organizational information metric (Omega), which will then be converted into graph representations and tensors, with invalid graphs excluded, and the data split by age strata. A gradient-boosting regression model (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) will be trained to predict brain age from graph-derived features, utilizing cross-validation and Mean Squared Error as the loss function. Performance will be assessed through Coefficient of Determination, Effect size for regression, Root Mean Squared Error, and Minimal Detectable Effect. The effects of physical activity, sleep, and dietary habits on brain-age gaps will be assessed using gradient-boosting regression models, incorporating socioeconomic status and social environment as additional predictors. Finally, feature importance will be evaluated using permutation importance, mean decrease in impurity, and SHapley Additive exPlanations values with 99% confidence intervals to identify significant predictors.","The analysis will explore the relationship between sleep quality and learning capacity using multivariate regression models and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Sleep quality will be assessed via the SEMA_sleep variable, which captures self-reported weekly sleep evaluation. Learning capacity will be measured by the fon_s01_tde_w0 variable, derived from standardized tests on mathematics, reading, and writing, as well as CBCL parent report of academic achievement. Substance use (psi_s03_confid_w1_w2), based on confidential self-reports, and physical activity (dom_s08_cbclp_w0w2), collected through parent-reported questionnaires on sports engagement and performance, will be treated as potential moderators.

Research suggests that excessive technology use may be both a contributor to and an indicator of underlying mental health difficulties, particularly among vulnerable youth. While these technologies offer benefits, excessive use has been associated with adverse outcomes, including depression, anxiety, social isolation, and sleep disturbances. High-risk adolescents may be particularly susceptible to developing problematic use patterns, possibly using digital technologies as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Recent advances in genetic research, particularly through polygenic risk scores (PRS), have suggested a potential genetic predisposition to both mental health vulnerabilities and addictive behaviors, including problematic technology use. However, the relationship between digital technology use, mental health, and genetic risk remains poorly understood. This study seeks to validate measurement tools and explore the complex interplay between problematic digital technology use, mental health indicators, and polygenic risk scores in a high-risk cohort.\n"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["aims_aims_max_5",": "]},"NA"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["hypo_hypothesis_max_5",": "]},"A higher prevalence of mental comorbidities among problematic technology users and an association with polygenic risk scores, particularly for anxiety and depression"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["dataplan_data_analysis_plan_max_20_lines",": "]},"First, descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables, including sociodemographic characteristics, problematic technology use measures, and mental health indicators. To validate the construct of problematic technology use, we will conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the relevant scales, alongside internal consistency analysis (Cronbach's alpha). Convergent and discriminant validity will be assessed through correlations with related measures, such as self report of technology use.\n\nThe association between problematic technology use and other variables will be examined using mixed-effects models, which account for the hierarchical structure of the data and repeated measurements over time. These models will include both fixed effects (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic status) and random effects to account for individual-level variation. The mixed modeling approach will allow us to examine both between-subject and within-subject effects while handling unbalanced data and missing values appropriately.\n\nThe relationship between polygenic risk scores and problematic technology use will be analyzed within the mixed model framework, controlling for relevant covariates. Mediation and moderation analyses will be conducted to explore potential pathways between genetic risk, mental health symptoms, and problematic technology use.\n\nAll analyses will account for multiple testing using appropriate corrections. Missing data will be handled through multiple imputation when appropriate. Statistical significance will be set at p < 0.05, and all analyses will be performed using R software.\n"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["waves_from_which_waves",": "]},"Screening, Wave0 (baseline) - 2010-2011, Wave1 - 2013-2014, Wave2 - 2018-2019, Wave2_Covid1 - 2020-2021, Wave2_Covid2 - 2021 apr-may"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["ext_do_you_want_your_database_in_which_extension",": "]},".rds (R, labelled data, use sjlabelled R package)"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["obs_observations",": "]},"NA"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["comitee_does_your_proposal_need_data_from_the_following_sections",": "]},"Dawba, Genetics"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["picot_p_population_or_problem_please_describe_the_eligibility_criteria_for_participants",": "]},"Children, adolescents and young adults from Brazil"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["picot_i_describe_the_intervention_exposure_issue_of_interest",": "]},"Problematic use of technologies"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["picot_c_comparison_what_is_the_alternative_for_intervention_exposure_issue_of_interest",": "]},"No problematic use of technologies"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["picot_o_what_are_the_outcome_you_would_like_to_study",": "]},"Association of the problematic use of technologies with mental health comorbidities, polygenic risk scores for mental health disorders, and other risk factors, such as socioeconomic status"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["picot_t_time_for_the_exposure_intervention_issue_of_interest_to_achieve_the_outcome",": "]},"lifelong"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["sent_mail",": "]},"1 Sent"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["has_sleep",": "]},"TRUE"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"8px","white-space":"pre-wrap","max-height":"300px","overflow-y":"auto"}},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["propid",": "]},"217_2025_4_25"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["carimbo_de_data_hora",": "]},"2025-04-25 13:10:58.656"]},{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"strong","attribs":{},"children":["rationale_rationale_and_background_max_10_lines",": "]},"Adolescence is a key neurodevelopment stage, with changes shaping cognitive and emotional functions.
